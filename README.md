I am a 'seasoned' programmer and software engineer with over 30 years of experience in wide variety of technologies and programming languages. 

As I am a quite enthusiastig gamer most of my hobby projects are related to game development in one way or another. But I work as a senior SW engineer in a company developing embedded solutions. I also compose music as a hobby, see my Soundcloud link below.

My blog I just started is @ https://codesmith.hashnode.dev/

My Soundcloud page is @ https://soundcloud.com/erno-pakarinen/

See you around!
