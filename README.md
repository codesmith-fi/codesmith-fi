I am a 'seasoned' programmer and software engineer with over 30 years of experience in wide variety of technologies and programming languages.

As I am a quite enthusiastig gamer most of my hobby projects are related to game development in one way or another. But I work as a senior SW engineer in a company developing embedded solutions. I also compose music as a hobby, see my Soundcloud link below.

You can reach me through my email codesmith.fi@gmail.com

I also lurk in Discord with a id of "xanaki#9472" if you want to contact and talk with me. You can also find me from several coding channels like One Lone Coder and GameFromScratch for example.

My own discord channel is "Knights who say RPG" @ https://discord.gg/P4Uu3GU7tx

My blog I just started is @ https://codesmith.hashnode.dev/

My Soundcloud page is @ https://soundcloud.com/erno-pakarinen/

See you around!
